From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

This is a mini-project to practice my knowledge of html and css; knowledge includes showing understanding of using css layout, html element.

In the final result of the project, I will have a clone non-function google search page.
